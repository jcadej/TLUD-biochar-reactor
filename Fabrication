An inexpensive TLUD can be constructed from a gallon (4L) paint can, galvanized sheet steel, and a few aluminum pop-rivets. Useful tools are an electric drill, sheet metal shears, and pliers.

A .pdf file shows templates for cutting components to build the DRAFT SHELL and CHIMNEY. Use the lightest gauge sheet metal available, if conducting experiments. Use appropriate care because
sheet metal edges are very sharp.

Ventilation holes for the bottom of the FUEL CHAMBER (paint can) can be about 1-2% of the horizontal cross-sectional area of the FUEL CHAMBER i.e. 13 holes of 1/4-inch or 6mm for a typical paint can.

For scaled-up projects, consider adding a side-wall drain hole to the DRAFT SHELL to let quench water escape.
