# TLUD-biochar-reactor
DIY simple biochar production with efficient combustion and no smoke - scale to larger sizes for greater capacity - batch process
TLUD signifies top-light-up-draft; a term of art in common use. The concept here is that flame on the top of a burning load of biomass will act to complete combustion of pyrolysis gasses and smoke particles, whereas a conventional fire at the bottom of a load of biomass is delivering heat upward where biomass can be pyrolyzed but the conditions may not support combustion. This is why a new-lit campfire produces smoke, for example. The simple design of the TLUD reactor incorporates features to collect heat from combustion and redirect it to the unburned biomass, and also maximize contact between combustion gas and inlet air so smoke and particulate emissions are minimized.

The reactor system features three components:

The FUEL CHAMBER, where biomass is loaded and where combustion occurs, and where biochar accumulates. Pre-heated air enters the fuel chamber from the bottom and pre-heats biomass.

The DRAFT SHELL, which encloses the fuel chamber below and on the sides - the updraft induced by convection over the flame zone creates low pressure which draws air into the bottom of the fuel chamber. This air must pass between the outer wall of the fuel chamber and the inner wall of the draft shell where it is heated by the fire chamber.

The CHIMNEY, which is placed over the fuel chamber and induces higher velocity gas flow as the combustion gas rises in a confined stream through surrounding dense ambient air.

Reactor operation consists of six steps: assembly, loading, ignition, chimney placement, burning, and quenching.

ASSEMBLY: Place the draft shell on a level non-combustible outside surface, with a safe work area on all sides (at least five feet). There should be no combustible materials within ten feet, because the draft shell can become very hot and radiate heat to surrounding surfaces. There should be no combustible material overhead. Some types of biomass can create sparks of fly-ash which could travel significant distance, so operation should not proceed if there is a risk of igniting surrounding vegetation or structures. The draft shell will have a drain and the shell should be placed where drainage of char-contaminated water will not create a nuisance.

If the fuel chamber is constructed without bottom supports, place supports such as bricks or metal in the draft shell to support the fuel chamber above the bottom of the draft shell. Center the fuel chamber inside the draft shell, so air can flow evenly in the annular space.

Leave the chimney aside. It will be placed after IGNITION.

LOADING: Load biomass into the fuel chamber. The bulk volume of the biomass should be 50 to 80% of the fuel chamber volume. There should be vertical paths left for air flow. Some materials, like pieces of wood stack readily in this configuration but other materials may require ingenuity. Chopped biomass that does not naturally form vertical air passages can be loaded with vertical-oriented pieces of perforated metal pipe. Fill the fuel chamber completely.

IGNITION: Starting a fire can be challenging. Easy-igniting and fast-burning materials are employed, particularly if the bulk combustibles are damp. Sufficient heat must be applied to bring combustible materials to about 500C temperature which means all moisture must be evaporated first. Sometimes an ample pile of dry paper is enough. Other times a small cup of "boy scout fire water", or kerosene as it is also known, may be necessary. Rather than dump such an ignition aid into the biomass, place it on top and provide a wick of fabric so the fuel burns steadily in contact with the top of the biomass.

CHIMNEY PLACEMENT: when a flame is established, immediately place the chimney over the fuel chamber. The small thermal updraft produced by kindling will help with igniting the surrounding biomass.

BURNING: When the biochar is ignited and the wall of the fuel chamber is hot, burning is rapid. By looking into inspection openings on the chimney, yellow flames should be visible. If it is dark, some faint flame may be visible at the top of the chimney. Eventually the flames will diminish leaving hot coals in the fuel chamber. When most yellow flame is gone, biochar production is maximized.

QUENCHING: After burning, remove the chimney (very hot), and place it in a safe location to cool. Add water to the biochar to extinguish flames and cool the char, otherwise it will continue to oxidize to ashes. When the fuel chamber is sufficiently cool, it can be helpful to remove it from the draft shell and dump the char where it can be spread out and inspected to verify no embers remain hot.
